## ***About Me***
Hello, I am Naman, a Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and Data Scientist.

I have experience working as a Data Analyst and a Team Lead, where I honed my skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling. With a background in Electrical Engineering and professional experience as a Testing Engineer in a production company, I bring a strong analytical mindset and problem-solving approach to data-driven challenges.

I have a deep interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI, and I enjoy working on projects involving Exploratory Data Analysis, Predictive Modeling, and Business Intelligence. My technical expertise includes Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Plotly), SQL, Power BI, and Advanced Excel. I actively work on real-world datasets, solve statistical problems using Python, and continuously explore new technologies to enhance my data engineering skills.

Beyond data, I am also focused on personal growth, including communication skills, public speaking, and confidence-building. I am always eager to connect, discuss ideas, and explore new challenges in data and technology.

Letâ€™s connect and have insightful conversations on data-driven problem-solving, career growth, and emerging tech trends!
